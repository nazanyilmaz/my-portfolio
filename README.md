<h1>My Prtfolio</h1>

<p>
  I created my personal portfolio using React and Next.js features. While the software languages and features I know are displayed on the main screen, when you click on Project, you can access all my projects that I have published on the GitHub page. You can also find my Twitter and LinkedIn links. Don't forget to click on the balloons
